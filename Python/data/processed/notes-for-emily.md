- Should I set LIKELY_DEAD to true for ALL of the rows of a dead fly or just after it dies











Now I understand! Channel 1 has a value of 15 for almost 7 hours straight (11:46 to 18:28), then starts showing realistic movement values.
This is highly suspicious and suggests one of these scenarios:

Possible Explanations:

Dead/Inactive Fly: The fly in channel 1 might have been dead or completely inactive from the start

Empty Channel: Channel 1 might have been empty (no fly)

DAM System Issue: The system might have been stuck reporting a baseline value

Calibration Mode: The system might have been in a test/calibration mode


Why This Matters:

You're absolutely right to question this! A fly cannot have exactly 15 beam breaks per minute for 7 consecutive hours. Real fly activity should show variation - even inactive flies would have occasional small movements.
